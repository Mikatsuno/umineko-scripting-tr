`Tekne bir anda titremeye başladı. `
`Limana yanaştık gibi görünüyor. `
`Teknenin sürücüsü dışarı çıktı ve bağlama halatıyla beraber iskeleye atladı. `
`Smokinli iri yarı bir adam da sıcak bir gülümsemeyle bizi bekliyordu. `
`......Onu çıkaramadım ama kıyafetlerine bakarak Ushiromiya Baş Hanesinin bir hizmetkârı olduğunu düşündüm. `
`"Hoş geldiniz, Leydim. `
`Oldukça geç kaldığınızdan endişelenmeye başlamıştım." `
`"Ah, ilgilendiğin için teşekkürler! `
`Bu moron çok korktu da, `
`biz de yavaşlamak zorunda kaldık. `
`Gerçekten sinir bozucuydu!" `
`"Ka-Kapa çeneni... Bir gün yer değiştirdiğimizde bunu hatırlayacaksın...ugghh." `
`Böyle devam ederse haber tüm aileye yayılacak ve akşam yemeğinde sohbetin en büyük konusu ben olacağım. `
`Bu olmasa bile, altı yıllık yokluğum yüzünden zaten herkes benim hakkımda konuşuyor olacaktı, ...ama şimdi onlara daha da leziz bir konu verdim...! `
`Kahretsin, Ushiromiya Baş Ailesi neden bu izole adada yaşıyor ki?! `
`Bu esnada, teknenin demirlenme işi tamamlanmıştı. `
`Tekneden inebilmemiz için küçük bir tahta koyuldu. `
`Ailelerimiz birer birer teknenin içinden çıktılar. `
`"Uzun yolculuğunuzdan dolayı hepiniz oldukça yorgun olmalısınız. `
`Madam, yardımcı olmama izin verin." `
`"Teşekkürler. `
`Uzun zaman oldu, Gohda-san. Nasılsın?" `
`"İlginiz için teşekkür ederim. `
`Hizmet etmekten her zaman memnuniyet duyarım." `
`"Battler-kun, Gohda-san ile ilk kez karşılaşıyorsun değil mi? `
`Yanılmıyorsam, altı yıl önce burada çalışmıyordun?" `
`"Doğru. `
`Bu yüzden lütfen onu ilk kez karşılamama izin verin. `
`Sizinle tanışmak bir onur, Battler-sama." `
`"......Boyum konusunda kendime güveniyorum ama sen dev gibisin. `
`...Kesinlikle ilk kez karşılaşıyoruz. `
`Senin gibi iri bir adamla tanışmış olsaydım, asla unutmazdım...! `
`Tanıştığıma memnun oldum. `
`Ben Battler." `
`"Sizinle tanışmayı dört gözle bekliyordum. `
`Ben Gohda ({p:0:郷田}), hizmetkârınız, iki yıldır Ushiromiya Baş Ailesi için çalışıyorum. `
`Sizinle tanışmak benim için bir zevk. `
`İhtiyacınız olan herhangi bir şey olursa, iletmekten çekinmeyin. Bana güvenebilirsiniz." `
`"Gohda-san, uzun zaman oldu." `
`"Çok uzun zaman oldu, George-sama. `
`Lütfen size eşlik etmeme izin verin." `
`"Her zamanki gibi misafir ağırlama konusunda profesyonelsin... `
`Eğer bir işe ihtiyacın olursa, bana haber ver, tamam mı? `
`Seni hemen işe alırım!" `
`"Beni çok onurlandırıyorsunuz. `
`Lütfen eşlik etmeme izin verin, Hideyoshi-sama." `
`Daha sonra Gohda-san, tekneden inen herkese elini uzattı ve geçerken onları karşıladı. `
`Konuşması ve tavırları bir profesyonelin kusursuzluğuna sahipti. `
`İlk bakıştaki sert görümününün aksine çok zarifti. `
`İri boyutu ilk başta biraz korkutucu görünmüştü, ama ilk izlenimimle karşılaştırıldığında çok daha kibar biriydi. `
`Adada iki yıldır hizmet ettiğini iddia ediyordu ama şüphesiz önceden de benzer bir işte çalışmıştı. `
`Herkes karaya çıktığında, bağlama halatı çözüldü ve tekne limandan uzaklaşmaya başladı. `
`Muhtemelen Niijima'daki kendi limanına dönüyordu. `
`Kaptan ellerini sallayarak veda etti. `
`Maria da ellerini bilinçli olarak sallayarak karşılık verdi. `
`"............Hmmm, şimdi düşündüm de bir süredir garip hissetmemin nedeni bu olmalı. `
`Martıların ağlamalarını duyamıyorum." `
`"Martılar? `
`Kuşlar mı?" `
`Eğer yanlış hatırlamıyorsam, eskiden bu adaya her geldiğimizde, martılar bizi hep canlı "nyaa nyaa" ağlamalarıyla karşılardı. `
`Bundan dolayı, ne zaman başka bir yerde martıların ağlamalarını duysam, bir aile konferansına geliyormuşum hissine kapılıyorum. `
`Ushiromiya Baş Ailesi'nin yaşadığı küçük kısım dışında, Rokkenjima doğal bırakıldı, bu da burayı yabani kuşlar için bir cennet haline getiriyor. `
`Söylenenlere göre, bir yerde büyük bir martı kolonisine ev sahipliği yapan bir uçurum var, bu yüzden bu ada her zaman martılarla dolu. `
`Bizi karşılayacak martıların olmayışı kendimi biraz yalnız hissetmeme neden oldu. `
`"Ne oldu, Battler-kun?" `
`"Oh, Rosa Hala. `
`...Hiç, önemli bir şey yok, sadece martıların ağlamalarını duymayınca biraz yalnız kaldığımı düşünüyordum." `
`"Aa, doğru ya, sen söyleyince fark ettim. `
`Her zaman çok gürültülü olmalarına rağmen, bugün görünürlerde yoklar." `
`"......Uu-? `
`Neden martı yok?" `
`"Hmmm, belki martılar da bir yerde bir araya gelmişlerdir? `
`Maria, martıları mı görmek istiyordun?" `
`"Uu-, görmek istiyordum." `
`"Yine de, etrafta bir tane bile olmaması biraz garip geliyor. `
`Belki Jessica hepsini kızartıp yemiştir!" `
`"......Uu-?!" `
`"Böyle rahatsız edici şeyler söyleme! `
`Maria yanlış anlayacak!!" `
`"Uu-uu-uu-! `
`Jessica onee-chan onları kızarttı, Jessica onee-chan onları kızarttı! `
`Uu-!!" `
`"Yapmadım, yapmadım! `
`Neden öyle bir şey yapayım ki?!" `
`"Öyle, öyleee, Jessica onları kızarttı! `
`Deriyle köfte, ciğerle soğaaan!" `
`"Et bebeklerde yüz! `
`Ciğerle soğaaan!! `
`Uu-uu-uu-! `
`Ahaha, ahaha! `
`Hahahaha!" `
`Jessica ile dalga geçerken, Maria da eğleniyormuşcasına peşime takıldı. `
`Ooh, onun böyle kafa dengi olacağını hiç tahmin etmezdim! `
`Peki o zaman, bugünden itibaren seni bir numaralı takipçim yapıyorum! `
`Ona gülümsediğimde, o da çok sevinçli bir şekilde gülümsedi, belli ki aramızda kurduğumuz bu minik ilişkiden mutluydu. `
`"Öyle değil, Maria-chan. `
`Yabani kuşların hava ve atmosferik basıncındaki değişimlere ayak uydurduğunu duymuştum. `
`Hava muhtemelen bu gece daha da kötüleşecek. `
`Martılar yuvalarına erken dönmüş olabilir." `
`".........Uu-. `
`Kızartmadı mı? `
`Jessica onee-chan onları kızartmadı mı?" `
`"Hayır, hayır!! `
`B-Ben öyle bir şey yapmam! `
`Battler, yalan söylediğini hemen itiraf et!" `
`"Battler-kun, `
`Maria-chan saf bir kız, bu yüzden şakaları bile ciddiye alıyor. `
`Şakalarını daha dikkatli seçmelisin." `
`...George-aniki beni nazikçe azarladı. `
`...Boy olarak Aniki'yi geçmiş olsam da, sonuçta Aniki yine Aniki'ydi. `
`Söz dinleyip özür dilemekten başka çare yoktu. `
`"P-Peki, `
`benim hatam, benim hatam... `
`Maria, bu bir şakaydı. `
`Bütün martılar bugün yuvalarında dinleniyor, hepsi bu." `
`"......Battler yalan mı söyledi? `
`George onii-chan doğruyu mu söyledi?" `
`O kadar eğlenmesine rağmen gerçekten de bu şakaya kanmış mıydı...? `
`Onun saf gözleri beni suçlu hissettirdi. `
`......Belki de biraz abartmıştım. `
`"Eeeveet, doğru, doğru. `
`George-aniki'nin dedikleri doğru. `
`Hava kötü olduğu için muhtemelen bugünlük evlerine döndüler. `
`Bu onların tamamen gitmiş oldukları anlamına gelmiyor. `
`Değil mi, Rosa Hala?!" `
`"Aynen öyle. `
`Yarın hava düzeldiğinde her zamanki "myaa myaa" ağlamalarını duyabilmemiz için geri geleceklerinden eminim." `
`"Uu-. `
`Hava düzelip onlar geri gelene kadar bekleyeceğim. `
`Yarına kadar bekleyeceğim. `
`Hava düzelene kadar bekleyeceğim. `
`Uu-uu-!" `
`Maria daha sakin bir ruh halindeydi ve martıların geri dönüp gökyüzünü dolduracağı yarını iple çekiyordu. `
`George-aniki çocuklarla ilgilenmede gerçekten bir harikaydı. `
`...Sanırım ben altı yıl önce bir veletken Aniki'nin benimle de iyi ilgilendiğini hatırlıyorum. `
`......Aniki, bu galiba senin yeteneğin. `
`"George-kun küçük çocuklarla ilgilenmekte harikasın. `
`Eğer isteseydin, eminim çocuk bakımında mükemmel bir iş çıkarırdın, sence de öyle değil mi?" `
`"Aynen, George nii-san tıpkı böyle bir şeyi yapmak için doğmuş. `
`Bence sana bir şirket başkanının ofisinde iş yapmaktan daha çok yakışırdı." `
`"Oh, yok artık. `
`Çocuk bakımı iyi bir kariyer yolu, `
`fakat yalnızca çocukları sevmenin yeterli olduğu bir iş değil." `
`"Sen gerçekten mütevazısın, George-kun. `
`Ama Battler-kun'un da çocuklarla arası oldukça iyi! `
`Daha demin çok sürmese bile, Maria çok eğleniyor gibi görünüyordu. `
`Lütfen az önce yaptığın gibi onunla oynamaya devam et. `
`Sadece şakalarını daha dikkatli seç, olur mu? `
`*kıkırdar*." `
`Rosa hala hafifçe kıkırdarken bana göz kırptı. `
`Kendi kendime; Maria'nın eğlendiğini görmekten mutluluk duyan gerçek bir anne, diye düşündüm. `
`"Hadi AMA, Rosa. `
`Ve siz veletler de neyle oyalanıyorsunuz? Hadi gidiyoruz." `
`"Tamam, tamam, geliyoruz." `
`Yaşlı piç acele etmemiz için bize el sallıyordu. `
`Evet, ilerlememiz gerekiyordu. `
`Bu konuşmayı valizlerimizi odalarımıza bıraktıktan sonra da yapabiliriz. `
`"Pekala millet, sizi geceyi geçireceğiniz konukevine kadar eşlik etmeme izin verin . `
`Lütfen, bu taraftan." `
`Gohda-san herkese seslendi ve yolu gösterdi. `
`Kumasawa-san da arkadan yetişti. `
`Bir yılan gibi kıvrımlı bu yol, loş bir ormandan geçiyordu. `
`Biraz yokuş yukarı çıkıyordu. `
`Sanırım yamaç çok dik durmasın diye yol tamamen dolambaçlı yapılmış, `
`ama şahsen, düz bir merdiven yapmaya cesaret etmiş olsalardı daha mutlu olurdum. `
`......Mesafeli ve önemliymiş havası vermek için yolu bilerek dolambaçlı yaptıklarına şüphe yok.... `
`Çok geçmeden, bahçe tarzı taş basamakları gördük. `
`...Aaah, buradan sonrasının hatırlar gibiyim. `
`Yukarı çık, ve... `
`Taş basamakların tepesinde, güzel bir konukevi göründü. `
`Binanın dışı çok güzeldi, ama daha da önemlisi, `
`......önünde yayılmış olan muhteşem gül bahçesinin ihtişamı karşısında kalplerimiz çalınmadan kapısından içeri giremedik. `
`"Aaah! `
`Bu yıl da her zamanki gibi çok zarif... `
`Gözler için gerçek bir şölen.." `
`Taş basamakları tırmandıktan sonra, bu muhteşem gül bahçesi tarafından karşılanan aile üyeleri teker teker izlenimlerini dile getirdi. `
`"Bana mı öyle geldi yoksa çiçekler bu yıl daha mı az hayat dolular? `
`Muhtemelen bu yaz o kadar da sıcak olmadığı içindir." `
`Ben de nedenlerden birinin o olduğuna inanıyorum. `
`Ne yazık ki bu yılki çiçek açma oranı geçen yıla kıyasla biraz daha düşük." `
`Öyle olsa bile, şahane bir gül bahçesiydi. `
`Altı yıl önce bile her yıl çok büyük sayıda gülün bizi karşıladığını hatırlıyorum. `
`...Bu gül bahçesi Rokkenjima'ya gelen insanları ilk karşılayan şeydi. `
`Her yıl gelen ebeveynlerimiz bile, hayranlıklarını dile getirmekten kendilerini alamıyorlardı. `
`Aslında, altı yıl önceki anılarımdaki bahçeden çok daha iyi durumda gibi görünüyordu. `
`"Bu yer her zaman muhteşem. `
`Evde böyle bir gül bahçem olsa ne güzel olurdu." `
`"Unut bunu. `
`Onlarla kimin ilgileneceğini düşünüyorsun? Güller, böcekler ve hastalıklarıyla tam bir baş belası." `
`"Duyduğum kadarıyla, `
`Kyrie nee-san her gün gülüyle ilgilenip yakınına hiçbir böceğin gelmediğinden emin oluyor, değil mi?" `
`"Huh? `
`Öyle mi? Onun böyle bir şey yaptığını bilmiyordum." `
`"Aynen öyle. `
`Gerçi bu kişiye göre gül; pis, kötü bir etobur bitki gibi böceklerin peşine düşüyor." `
`"...Oh, yani demek istediğin buydu. `
`Haydi, Rosa, sadece bugünlük rahat bıraksan? `
`Böyle şeyleri tamamen geride bıraktım." `
`"Bilemiyorum. `
`Ne de olsa, sen neredeyse genetik seviyede bir kadın avcısısın...!" `
`"Endişelenmene gerek yok, Rosa-san. `
`Bir gül sana çok fazla sorun çıkardığında, onu kökünden koparmak her zaman en iyisidir." `
`"Hohohohoh, bu ne kadar da korkutucu bir konuşma." `
`"Bayanlar arasında popüler olan adamlar hayatı her zaman tehlikeli bir şekilde yaşamaya zorlanır. `
`Umarım sonraki hayatımda birazcık daha sevimli olurum!" `
`"Hideyoshi nii-san, söylediğim gibi, hiç de öyle değil. `
`...Ve Kyrie...kes artık, beni geriyorsun. `
`Gülümü soldurdun." `
`"Hey, Maria-chan, buraya baksana. `
`Buradaki güller özellikle muhteşem." `
`"...Muhteşem güller. `
`...Uu-!" `
`"Hmmm, çok tatlı kokuyor. `
`Bak, bu zarafetime tamamen uyuyor." `
`"Hey, kes şunu! `
`Maria seni taklit edecek ve dikenler yüzünden canı yanacak!" `
`Gülün kokusunu almak için abartılı bir hareketle eğilirken bana bağırdı. `
`...Bunun aşırı bir tepki olduğunu sanmıştım, ama arkamı döndüğümde, Maria'nın her hareketimi taklit ettiğini ve George-aniki'nin bize gülümsediğini gördüm. `
`"Hey, Maria-chan, dikkatli ol. `
`Gülün dikenleri canını yakabilir." `
`"......Uu-? `
`......George onii-chan, `
`bu gül diğerlerine göre garip. `
`Uu-." `
`"Garip mi? `
`Sorun ne?" `
`Maria güllerden birini işaret etti. `
`O gülü neden garip bulduğunu anında anladım. `
`Bu muhteşem güllerin arasında, tek bir gül solmaya başlamıştı. `
`Bunun özel bir nedeni yoktu. `
`Bazı güller açar, ve bazıları ise solar. `
`Hepsi buydu ama Maria aralarındaki tek sağlıksız olan için çok endişeli görünüyordu. `
`...Bu onu yalnız hissettirmiş olmalı. `
`"Yani, sağlıklı olmayan tek gül bu olduğu için mi üzgün hissediyorsun...?" `
`"......Uu-. `
`Diğer hepsi sağlıklı ama bu üzgün." `
`"Eh, hepsi kendi hızlarında çiçek açarlar ve solarlar. `
`Bahse girerim ki bu gül diğerlerinden daha önce açtığı için hepsinden önce solmaya başlıyor." `
`"Evet, aynen öyle. `
`Muhtemelen deli gibi çiçek açtı, görevini yerine getirdi ve uykuya daldı. `
`Bunun için canını sıkmamalısın." `
`".........Uu-." `
`Görünüşe göre Maria'nın saf ve hassas doğası, tek başına solan gül için duygusal bir acı hissetmesine neden oluyordu. `
`Mantığını anlamış olmasına rağmen, yine de ona yalnızlık hissi veriyordu. `
`"Pekala, Maria-chan, `
`neden gidene kadar bu güle göz kulak olmuyorsun?" `
`"Uu-?" `
`George-aniki doğruldu ve cebini yokladı. `
`Ardından uçakta yediği şekerin ambalajını çıkardı. `
`İnce bir ip şeklinde kıvırdıktan sonra bir çeşit işaretçi olması için nazikçe güle bağladı. `
`"Heeey, bu oldukça tatlı oldu!" `
`"Onu bununla işaretleyelim. `
`Daha sonra buraya gelip ona su verebilirsin. `
`Eminim ki Bay Gül'ün hoşuna gidecektir." `
`"......Uu-! `
`Daha sonra su vermeye geleceğim!" `
`"Bence Bay Gül'e bir isim koymalısın. `
`Eminim bu onu mutlu edecek ve böylece birbirinizi daha yakından tanıyabileceksiniz." `
`"İsim mi...? `
`İsim... `
`......Uu-uu-..." `
`Her zamanki ifadesiz suratına rağmen Maria kollarını kavuşturdu ve dikkatle bunu düşünmeye başladı. `
`En azından yaşadığı çöküşten tamamen kurtulmuş gibi görünüyordu. `
`İyi iş, Aniki. `
`"George nii-san her zaman çok anlayışlı. `
`Ona saygı duymamak elde değil." `
`"Cidden. `
`Sanırım o doğuştan böyle. `
`Ondan taktikleri öğrenmeye başlamalıyız!" `
`"Siz hepiniz çocukken de bu bahçe böyle büyüleyici miydi?" `
`"It was only after I left the house that it became this grand.`
` Though I was more fond of the previous rustic garden.`
` Nii‐san fiddled with it too much, with his slightly questionable taste.`
` It was much better the way it was before."`
`"Eva, you've gotta think positive!`
` No matter how it might've looked, its beauty now is something to be admired.`
` You'll be able to relax a lot better if you look at it that way."`
`"I didn't mean it like that...`
` I was just saying that I would have liked you to have seen the old, more wonderful garden as well."`
`"Now then, everyone, if you please.`
` I shall be guiding you to the rooms now."`
`Gohda‐san called to everyone to ask if we were ready,`
` but our hearts had been completely stolen away by the {ruby:çeviri > gül bahçesi:rose garden} after a year of absence, and we didn't lend him an ear.`
`Since we weren't a travel group, it wasn't like we had a strict schedule to follow.`
`Besides, for our parents, this was their fond old birth home they had returned to, so they felt no obligation to be pressured by anyone.`
`Understanding the situation, Gohda‐san continued to wait, with a wide smile, for our parents to lose interest in the roses and tell him to guide us to the rooms...`
`"My...!`
` Heeey!`
` If it isn't Kanon‐kun!`
` It's been so long, how are you doin'?!"`
`Uncle Hideyoshi suddenly shouted.`
`In the direction he was waving,`
` .........there was a slender boy.`
`Meeting him right after a huge man like Gohda probably emphasized his small stature.`
`The boy was in the middle of transporting piled‐up gardening tools and the like in a wheelbarrow.`
`When he realized he was being called to stop, he set down the wheelbarrow, took his hat off and bowed his head.`
`"..................`
` .........Good afternoon."`
`...I figured he was probably younger than me.`
`{n}I realized by the general atmosphere surrounding him that he was a {ruby:çeviri > hizmetkar:servant} too.`
`Though he did greet Uncle Hideyoshi back, he himself seemed like he might be unsociable.`
`It was a greeting that lacked feeling.`
`When Gohda‐san noticed that our interest had shifted towards him, he went to the boy's side and introduced him to us.`
`"Battler‐sama, I shall introduce you.`
` He is one of the {ruby:çeviri > hizmetkarlar:servants} who serve the Ushiromiya head house.`
` ...Kanon‐san, greet our guest."`
`"..................I'm pleased to meet you.`
` I am the {ruby:çeviri > hizmetkar:servant}............`
`Kanon ({p:0:嘉音})."`
`Yep, my first impression wasn't wrong—he gave the feeling that he was unsociable, or maybe a bit of a poor speaker.`
`In contrast with Gohda‐san, who was extraordinarily polished as a {ruby:çeviri > hizmetkar:servant},`
` it was impossible not to feel the immaturity you'd expect of someone his age.`
`When Gohda‐san urged him in a whisper to give a bit more of an introduction, the boy named Kanon only cast his eyes downwards.`
`"Kanon‐san.`
` Could you perhaps give them a little more as a greeting...?"`
`"............I can't.`
` ............Because we...`
`...are {ruby:çeviri > mobilya:furniture}."`
`It seemed that he wasn't refusing to greet us out of spite,`
` but rather, he gave the impression that he didn't know what else to add to his greeting, and so could do nothing other than stay silent.`
`"Ah, uh, Kanon‐kun's a man of few words.`
` He might not be that sociable, but deep down he's really a good person!`
` Don't get him wrong...!"`
`"You've been working here for three years, was it?`
` So yeah, you've been here a year longer than Gohda‐san, right, Kanon‐kun?"`
`Even though it's not like he made a super bad impression, Jessica hurriedly backed him up.`
`...I see, apparently him being unsociable works against him all the time.`
`"Cool, nice to meet you.`
` I'm Battler!`
` I'm 18, how old are you?"`
`"..........................."`
`A silence, as if evaluating whether it was a question that must be answered or not.`
`{n}...But here again, Jessica plowed ahead.`
`"Um, uhh...!`
` If I remember correctly, he's two years younger than us so...16, right?"`
`"............Yes, ...that is correct."`
`It looked like if given a choice, he would have preferred not to tell us his age.`
`Him not wanting to tell his age was probably because he thought he would be looked down upon for it.`
`...I remember that when I was around his age, I hated being asked how old I was by adults.`
`...I see, 16, huh?`
`{n}That's gotta be a delicate time.`
`{n}...In that case, I asked something I shouldn't have.`
`"Heh heh~, I'm glad you're about our age!`
` Just be cool and call me Battler!`
` And I'll call you Kanon!"`
`".........Thank you very much.`
` But just the sentiment is sufficient, ...Battler‐sama."`
`Jessica looked flustered for some reason.`
`{n}She seemed to think that my impression of Kanon was worsening because of his rejection.`
`Well, I doubt a girl like Jessica understands his fretful male heart.`
`As his elder—even by just two years—who would lead him into adolescence, I took it upon myself to understand that.`
`"Kanon‐san, could you perhaps be a little more courteous?`
` A smiling face is also the duty of a {ruby:çeviri > hizmetkar:servant}."`
`"...............I apologize.`
` ...I shall make an effort."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Gohda‐san, Kanon‐kun is trying his best, isn't he?"`
`It seemed as though he was often warned about his discourtesy.`
`{n}And apparently he hadn't improved a bit.`
`Gohda‐san kept his business‐smile, but let a small sigh of resignation escape.`
`"......Well then, I still have work to do.`
` .........If you'll excuse me."`
`It looked like Kanon himself was uncomfortable with remaining silent here any longer.`
`After another perfunctory bow, he turned on his heels and started pushing the wheelbarrow again.`
`Just then, suddenly, the wheelbarrow wobbled and fell, scattering the load.`
`I guess the wheelbarrow with its single wheel caught on a pebble and lost its balance.`
`"What have you done...now now, quickly clean it up...!"`
`Gohda‐san urged him along in a low voice, as if to remind him that it is a {ruby:çeviri > hizmetkar:servant}'s shame to present a clumsy appearance in front of guests.`
`Showing that he understood quite well without being told, Kanon‐kun wordlessly reloaded the wheelbarrow with the fallen objects.`
`He seemed to be fine with the light‐looking gardening tools, shovels and such, but he looked like he was having trouble getting his arms around and lifting up some sacks of fertilizer.`
`"Are you alright? You're so careless.`
` Here."`
`"{ruby:çeviri > Leydim:Milady}, you will dirty your garments.`
` Please, leave it to him."`
`With an elegant gesture, Gohda‐san took the shovel that Jessica had picked up.`
`At his back was the figure of Kanon‐kun having trouble with the sacks of fertilizer.`
`"......Uu.`
` You'll dirty your garments?"`
`"Don't worry, the ones I'm wearing aren't that elegant."`
`"Besides, I hate guys who make the waitress pick up the fork they dropped at a restaurant."`
`I lifted up the other bags that had fallen.`
`{n}Of course, they weren't light, but for me it was a piece of cake.`
`Kanon‐kun turned his surprised eyes towards me.`
`{n}It was the face of one who would never have expected to receive help from a guest.`
`"............B‐Battler‐sama...`
` That's not necessary... I'll take care of everything, so..."`
`"Don't you worry!`
` I may not look it, but I've got it where it counts!`
` Heheh!"`
`Kanon‐kun looked like he hadn't yet gone through his growth spurt, and was stuck with a sorta weak body.`
`I guess this kind of weight is a bit much for him.`
`"It's quite heavy, isn't it.`
` It's natural that it would be difficult for you.`
` Kanon‐kun, don't worry about it."`
`"OK, my time to shine.`
` This makes up for the boat part from before, right?"`
`"Ha!`
` As if your antics earlier could be written off just like that!`
` Ah‐hah‐hah‐ha!`
` I'll tell you all about it later, Kanon‐kun—Battler is a laugh and a half!"`
`"Gonna faaall gonna faaall!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`Banter made the job seem quick, and before I knew it, all the stuff had been piled back into the wheelbarrow.`
`"............For letting you see such unsightliness, I beg your forgiveness."`
`"Very well, enough now.`
` Please, go."`
`Letting such a disgraceful thing be seen by the guests who were supposed to be made welcome...must have been hideously embarrassing as a {ruby:çeviri > hizmetkar:servant}.`
`Pressed by Gohda to hurry up and exit, Kanon‐kun left.`
`"You're too harsh on him, Gohda‐san.`
` Wouldn't it have been better if you'd helped him, instead of being a bully?"`
`"...You are quite correct.`
` I deeply, deeply implore your forgiveness."`
`Without even a twitch in his smile, Gohda‐san apologized elegantly.`
`"Kanon‐kun has a ton a things he's good at too.`
` It's just that bein' young works against him all the time.`
` It's a cryin' shame."`
`"It's a prickly age.`
` You be nice to him.`
` Keeping a tight lip is just what you want in a {ruby:çeviri > hizmetkar:servant}.`
` Right, Kumasawa‐san?"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho, Rudolf‐sama, you truly are harsh!`
` There is no {ruby:çeviri > hizmetkar:servant} as silent as I, of course!"`
`Everyone smiled wryly at that shameless lie.`
`{n}Even she herself didn't believe that, not in her wildest dreams.`
`{n}She said that to loosen us all up.`
`Yeah, that's the kind of character Kumasawa baa‐chan used to be.`
`The mood that had stiffened a little was cleared up in a twinkling, thanks to Kumasawa‐san's cheerful smile.`
`"I'd like to put down the luggage soon.`
` Gohda‐san, how are we to split up for our rooms?"`
`"It shall be the same as last year.`
` I shall guide you.`
` Please, this way."`
`We headed towards the trim and elegant {ruby:çeviri > konukevi:guesthouse}.`
`{n}This was going to be our temporary quarters for a night.`
`".........................................."`
`Kanon watched over a hedge as the guests all entered the {ruby:çeviri > konukevi:guesthouse}.`
`Then, he let his eyes fall on those heavy sacks of fertilizer, piled up in the wheelbarrow.`
`In his mind, he kept going over his previous mistake.`
`{n}Battler, big and strong, had picked up the sacks in front of him, the sacks he couldn't lift himself, as if they were feathers.`
`It was extremely difficult for an outside observer to guess what emotions that favor had stirred up in Kanon.`
`But as far as you could tell by watching him hang his head from behind, there was something that he just couldn't let go.`
`...Muttered words escaped his lips.`
`{n}But those words he murmured were so soft that they didn't reach even his own ears.`
`"...............Even I...`
`........................"`
`Kanon hung his head, slightly biting his lower lip...`
`"I remember the {ruby:çeviri > gül bahçesi:rose garden}, but...`
`I don't remember this {ruby:çeviri > konukevi:guesthouse} at all.`
` Was it built, like, recently?"`
`"Toraian" (Visitor's Retreat) was written on a gatepost‐like thing, but since everyone called it the {ruby:çeviri > konukevi:guesthouse}, I followed their lead.`
`The brand‐new Western‐style {ruby:çeviri > konukevi:guesthouse} that stood overlooking the {ruby:çeviri > gül bahçesi:rose garden} had a magnificent design carefully done in harmony with the garden.`
`"Correct!`
` It was built just the year before last.`
` Since then, we've been having them let us sleep over here."`
`"Hehe, yeah, 'cause people seem to like this place more than that junky old {ruby:çeviri > malikane:mansion} we've had forever.`
` I wish my room was over here!"`
`"Uu!`
` I want one too!`
` Want one too!"`
`...I guess you could call my house upper‐class as well, but I was reminded again how completely ordinary it was compared to the head house.`
`It showed a shocking display of wealth that they would build this kind of awesome {ruby:çeviri > konukevi:guesthouse} for guests who come over like once a year.`
`"Eva‐sama, Hideyoshi‐sama.`
` Please, do make use of this room.`
` Rudolf‐sama, Kyrie‐sama, please make use of this room here."`
`"Ah yes, I do appreciate how pretty and elegant this place is.`
` Western style truly is wonderful."`
`"I can handle the Western style for a few days, but any longer than that and you need the good old Japanese style!`
` Japanese people just relax best on tatami mats."`
`"...Haha, they've been fighting over making our new house Japanese‐style or Western‐style.`
` Mother still holds a grudge about Father having started the construction as Japanese‐style, and they bicker all the time about it."`
`"Your parents get along so well, George nii‐san... I'm jealous as hell.`
` Mine are so frosty.`
` And yet they're right with each other when it comes to my grades."`
`All the rooms seemed to be two‐person.`
`{n}I was grateful, because now I wasn't gonna be forced to share the same room with the old bastard for some bullshit reason like "being family".`
`Besides, I figure those two wouldn't be able to enjoy themselves with someone like me around, ihihi.`
`"What's that creepy smile all about?`
` You're thinking about something dirty, aren't you."`
`"Ihihihi~!`
` Something diiirrrty? Of coouurse no~t!`
` Please...enjoy your staaay~!"`
`"Ow, owowowow!`
` That hurts, you old bastard!"`
`Once again, Dad pulled my ears from behind.`
`"Cut the crap.`
` I'm getting a stomachache, and I'm not in the mood for this.`
` You're the guest of honor this time around.`
` You play as nice as possible with Dad and Aniki and the rest."`
`"......At the very least, pay attention to what you say in front of Dad, got it?`
` 'Cause wisecracks go over like a lead balloon with him.`
` ......Jessica‐chan, what's the mood of our family head been like lately?"`
`"...Hmm......`
`same as last year, I guess.`
` ......Considering they keep saying he's got three months left, he's as lively,`
` grumpy,`
` and irritable as ever."`
`"Meaning, he's in his usual bad mood again this year.`
` ......And the only one who's able to take care of him is Genji‐san?"`
`"It seems that the {ruby:çeviri > Efendi:Master} will only open his heart to Genji‐san.`
` Lately, us small people cannot even get an audience..."`
`"He's shut himself up in his study again, probably doing nothing but that weird black {ruby:çeviri > büyü:magic} of his.`
` What he does for a hobby is his own damn business, but when he starts stinking up the place, it really gets on my nerves.`
` ...He can just stay in that study and never come out again for all I care.`
` Heheheh!"`
`"You shouldn't talk like that about the elderly.`
` We're all indebted to him, since he rebuilt the Ushiromiya family, and a little gratitude wouldn't hurt."`
`"Hm...well...`
` ......Sorry."`
`After being rebuked by George‐aniki, Jessica had no choice but to take back her thoughtless remark.`
`The Ushiromiya family was wealthy beyond belief, but that, of course, meant that all its members were eccentric people, completely at odds with the rest of society.`
`The Head of the family, standing at its peak—in other words, our Grandfather—seemed to be a particularly eccentric and terrifying person, even for our family.`
`Dad had said he was getting a stomachache earlier, but I guess that was what all the adults who came here today were actually feeling.`
`No doubt they were jealous of us, the grandchildren, just playing and laughing without a care.`
`From the stories Dad told me, the head of the family was a violent man who rained blows on his sons with his own fists and even beat his daughters mercilessly with a wooden sword.`
`If he was such a staunch traditionalist with his kids, why wasn't he the same with their names?`
`Because of that, even us grandkids have to suffer.`
`......Well, I have absolutely no trouble believing the terrifying image they paint of him.`
`I don't have many memories of meeting him over the years, but I remember his face was full of menacing thunder‐clouds, always making the people around him shrink away with a sharp look.`
`I remember that the room's atmosphere got so tense whenever he was around, you couldn't even breathe.`
`What my dad said right now about me being the guest of honor now carries a little more oomph for me.`
`".........Six years ago I was in grade school, but I'm a high‐schooler now, there's no getting away from it.`
` If I don't show him respect, things'll probably get serious.`
` ...Ooo, scary."`
`"He does look frightening, but he's not completely terrifying.`
` He's definitely never unfair.`
` He's just not a pretty talker, that's all."`
`"But George nii‐san, you've been the family darling since like forever because of your awesome grades, right?`
` Grandfather treats us completely different!"`
`"Like me, I've gotten slapped with a wooden sword.`
` On my ass, my ass!`
` On my maidenly naked ass!"`
`"Well, you're the heiress of the head house, Jessica‐chan.`
` Grandfather is giving you special attention.`
` You have to realize that his strictness shows how much he's expecting of you."`
`"Oh, come on.`
` ...Seriously, I could just turn the succession over to you, George nii‐san.`
` It's a bit of a heavy burden for me to carry."`
`I think I already said it before, but Jessica is the daughter who will inherit the head house.`
`{n}The pressure on her shoulders must be different from us cousins of the branch families.`
`".........Uu?`
` Jessica onee‐chan, heavy?`
` If I hold it, will it get lighter?"`
`"Hm?`
` Ahahahaha, thanks.`
` It's alright, it's not gonna get pushed on you, Maria‐chan."`
`"......I'm gonna bear that cross until my grave.`
` ...Don't worry."`
`While grateful for Maria's innocent consideration, it seemed that Jessica could not easily rid herself of the anxiety for the future that remained visible on her face.`
`...I guess I'm no different.`
` Any high‐schooler with exams looming ahead is bound to have an anxiety for the future that they can't hide.`
`"Maria, come here.`
` You'll be in this room with Mom."`
`"Battler‐kun, apparently you are with me in this room here."`
`"Oh?`
` This i~s a surprise!`
` It's bigger than our parents' room, wo~w!"`
`"I figured us cousins are probably all going to gather in one place anyway.`
` So I went and told them to make it a biggish room."`
`"Uu!`
` I like here best too!`
` Here is better than being together with Mama!`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`"Okay, you like it here better too, Maria!`
` Alright, this room is George's and mine, but we'll give you special permission to come in!`
` Keep it a secret from your mom, alright?"`
`"Uu!`
` Secret!"`
`Her mother, {ruby:çeviri > Hala:Auntie} Rosa, was right behind her, but Maria still answered, striking the air with her fists clenched tight.`
`After our parents put the luggage in the rooms, they gathered again in the corridor.`
`"So, brats, what're you gonna do?`
` Are you cousins just gonna stay here and chat?"`
`It seemed they were heading to the {ruby:çeviri > malikane:mansion} to announce their arrival.`
`...Normally, we would have had to follow them and greet everyone together,`
` but if that had been the case, Dad would just have said "You guys come too!" and been done with it.`
`He's telling us that it's alright if we don't come... So what'll we do?`
`"It's gonna be time for lunch soon anyway.`
` Better let the kids unwind here.`
` Besides, if worst comes to worst, this might be the last chance they get to play outdoors."`
`"Uu!`
` I'll go too!"`
`"Maria, you house‐sit for Mama, okay?`
` You behave yourself and wait here."`
`"......Uu."`
`Now that Maria had been told to house‐sit, we couldn't just leave her behind.`
`George‐aniki realized that immediately, and gave a clear reply for all of us.`
`"Well, we'll accept your offer and house‐sit.`
` We have lots of stories to tell each other, after a year."`
`"That would be best.`
` And Battler‐kun has six years' worth to tell, after all!"`
`"Yeah, yeah.`
` I'll take care of the house like a good little boy."`
`"Kumasawa‐san, I'm gonna stay here too!`
` We'll leave the rest to the adults and us kids'll break rank, heheheh!"`
`"That would be for the best, hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` I'll report it to Madam..."`
`"Then, everyone, I will be guiding you to the {ruby:çeviri > malikane:mansion}.`
` Please, this way."`
`"...The other kids aside, George is an adult now. Wouldn't it be better if he came with us?"`
`"If we make him come, poor George'll be the only one left out.`
` Interactin' with his cousins is also important.`
` Well then, see ya, guys!"`
`The adults left one after the other.`
`Like the time he had guided us from the harbor, Gohda‐san went ahead, with Kumasawa‐san at the rear.`
`As we gathered in the cousins' room assigned to us, George‐aniki asked us to excuse him for a second.`
` He rushed over to Kumasawa‐san, who was following behind the disappearing adults, and seemed to be asking her something.`
`He soon finished his business and came back.`
`"What's up, Aniki?"`
`"Ah, nothing.`
` I just wanted to ask something."`
`"Uu!`
` Ask me too!`
` Ask me tooo!"`
`"......Hm~?`
` Hmhuhuhuhu.`
` What could it be that George nii‐san asks Kumasawa‐san and doesn't ask me, I wonder~?`
` Ah, I don't have a clue~!"`
`"No, you misunderstand...!`
` I'm not sure what you're misunderstanding but...!"`
`Aniki was getting pretty tongue‐tied.`
`It's like he has something to hide, and Jessica has the dirt on him.`
`...Whatever it is, something only Jessica knows and I don't is no fun at all!`
`"Hey, Maria, it's not fair that we're the only ones out of the loop, is it no~w?!`
` We wanna hear what they're talking about, don't we~?!"`
`"Uu!`
` Battler and me want to know too!`
` Battler and me want to know too!"`
`""Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!""`
`I fooled around while "uu‐uu"ing together with Maria.`
`"No, I'm telling you...it's no big deal, ahahaha..."`
`"Li~ar!`
` You suck at lying, now confess!`
` Maria, you tickle his right side, I'll tickle his left!"`
`"Uu!`
` Me on the right side, Battler on the left!`
` Uu!"`
`"Wait a second!!`
` Wait you two...!!`
` Ahahaha, stop,`
` ahahahahahaha!!"`
`George‐aniki rolled around on the bed in an effort to get away, and Maria and I played around chasing him.`
`There's something in the back of my mind telling me I'm a high‐schooler now and not a damn kitten, but in spite of that, I missed this kind of fun.`
`A warm kind of fun.`
`"Haahahahaha, what George nii‐san was asking Kumasawa‐san, see...`
` Hmm~?`
` Well, you know how it is.`
` It's been a year since he last came to the head house.`
` Apparently he's really dying to say hi to any {ruby:çeviri > hizmetkarlar:servants} that might have joined or quit in the meantime, see?"`
`"......Uu?`
` Say hi, I'll say hi too!"`
`"What the hell, that's not anything to feel guilty about, Aniki.`
` ......Hmm~~m?`
` That's not it, is it??`
` Maria, don't be fooled, Aniki's still hiding somethi~ng!`
` Resume interrogation!!`
` Uworyaaa!!"`
`"S‐stop it, seriously!`
` Aahahahahaha!`
` Maria‐chan, you too, stop already!!"`
`"Aahahahahaha, aahahahahaha!`
` *giggle*giggle*!!"`
`"They're probably busy with cleaning or lunch arrangements.`
` It's alright, we'll go and greet them properly afterwards.`
` Basically, you wanted Shannon out there to greet you, not that Gohda getting in the way, right?!`
` Heeheheh!"`
`"Shannon?`
` ......Shannon.`
` ......Aaaaaaaaahh...`
` I remember, that girl!`
` She's still a {ruby:çeviri > hizmetkar:servant} now?`
` How is she?!"`
`"By the way, Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` How's your headache been lately?`
` It seemed to be pretty serious for a time."`
`"...I have been much better lately.`
` Thank you for your concern."`
`"Oh, right, here.`
` A present for you, Natsuhi nee‐san."`
`"......Thank you once again.`
` I'm always receiving gifts from you.`
` ...Is this black tea?"`
`"It's herb tea with peppermint and lemon balm.`
` It's a blend from a famous store and is supposed to be good for headaches.`
` I thought it might help you too."`
`Rosa was always a conscientious woman.`
`...Probably because she was the youngest of four, and by quite some distance,`
` she managed to grow up without harboring the venomosity of her siblings.`
`Her consideration made Natsuhi soften her expression for just a moment,`
` but it wasn't enough to undo the many years of anxiety that had curdled her expression into one of bland indifference...`
`"Oh yes, you always were saying you get those headaches.`
` Pull yourself together.`
` Jessica‐chan will have her exams this year, won't she?`
` Isn't that a turning point in her life?`
` How can she count on her mother like that?`
` Besides, Natsuhi nee‐san, you're three years younger than me.`
` Can't you pull yourself together?"`
`"............`
` .........I apologize.`
` I was born with this discomfort."`
`Eva sometimes fails to choose her words carefully, but even though she hid it with a smile, her comments aimed at Natsuhi contained shards of obvious malice.`
`Of course, that didn't escape Natsuhi.`
`She frantically contained her urge to grimace, and pretended to ignore Eva.`
`"Our Battler‐kun will have his exams this year too, right?`
` Rudolf‐san, shouldn't you be a little concerned too?`
` For the sake of your own son, get serious to the point of getting headaches like Natsuhi nee‐san."`
`"If I say anything, he automatically goes against it.`
` So what should I say—maybe the opposite, that it's okay for him to mess around?`
` That's probably the only thing he'd obediently listen to."`
`"In your family, Hideyoshi nii‐san, didn't George do really well on his exams?`
` Please, teach me the secret to controlling children."`
`"Hmm, well...`
` It's probably because I convinced him why he should study!`
` Study isn't worth anything on its own."`
`"That's right, the real point of studyin' is to train yourself in the art of researchin' what you don't know!`
` If you can't do that, you can't be useful to society!`
` I'm not talkin' about math or writin'.`
` You need to learn how to learn!"`
`"...That's splendid.`
` It would be nice if our Jessica could understand that, though.`
` I don't mean this too seriously, but as it is, as an heiress of the Ushiromiya family, she's—"`
`"Do you really have to force her into becoming the {ruby:çeviri > halef:successor}?`
` Women have to find their own happiness.`
` Parents shouldn't be deciding that for their children, right?"`
`"Hold your horses, Eva.`
` Each family has its way to raise their children.`
` You shouldn't be pushy."`
`"I'm sorry.`
` Natsuhi nee‐san, don't take it the wrong way."`
`"..........................."`
`Though the light shining in through the window was quite warm despite the cloudy weather, there was a dark mood about the room,`
` ...which probably caused headaches for other people besides Natsuhi.`
`As if to brush away that mood, Kyrie brightly made a suggestion to all present.`
`"Still, this black tea has a really lovely aroma.`
` Let's drink it at once.`
` I believe that in Japan, you can't buy something like Leopold's black tea anywhere but Ginza, right?"`
`"Kyrie nee‐san, how knowledgeable of you.`
` It really was worth buying."`
`Kyrie and Rosa stood up from their seats and made as if to prepare the black tea.`
`{n}Natsuhi forestalled them.`
`"......Thank you both.`
` Let us save that for later.`
` One of our people will soon be coming to bring some tea, so please relax."`
`"Leave it for later, you two.`
` Let them treat us to a "welcome drink" at least."`
`Rudolf gave a subtle signal with his eyes for them to sit down again.`
`{n}...Kyrie and Rosa understood instantly and obediently returned to their seats.`
`The guests had already been greeted, so it was time for some tea to be prepared for them.`
`...That tea was late, and having the guests talk about making some themselves was an embarrassment for the host.`
`Natsuhi bit her lower lip, frustrated with the ineptitude of the {ruby:çeviri > hizmetkarlar:servants} who were taking too long to bring the tea.`
`...Seeing her face, Eva, without hesitation, started to giggle.`
`......Of course, Shannon had no way of knowing what was taking place in the {ruby:çeviri > salon:parlor}.`
`As she came in pushing a dish cart piled with tea cups,`
` Natsuhi gave her a pained look for no apparent reason, and Shannon couldn't help but flinch without knowing what she had done wrong.`
`"......E‐excuse me.`
` I shall prepare some tea for you."`
`"Oh, Shannon‐chan, it's been a while!`
` You keep getting prettier every time I see you!"`
`".........Oh,`
` ...um,`
` .........thanks—"`
`"Leave the chatting for after you've set the table.`
` The tea will get cold."`
`"......I, ...I apologize, Madam."`
`She apologized like a small frightened animal, and, bumping against the serving cart, made a jarring racket as she dropped several tea spoons.`
`Her clumsiness made Natsuhi's expression even harsher, which made Shannon in turn quail even more.`
`"It's alright, Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` What does a single greeting matter?`
` We've already been made to wait for so long, the tea must be quite cold anyway.`
` Heheheh."`
`"It, ...it's alright...`
` It's not cold yet, so—"`
`".........Shannon, finish setting the table, quickly."`
`"I, I'm sorry, Madam......"`
`It was obvious that Natsuhi was getting irritated.`
`...The ineptitude that delayed the tea, the clumsiness of the {ruby:çeviri > hizmetkar:servant}—everything pointed to the incompetence of Natsuhi's everyday guidance, making her lose face.`
`As the person in charge of matters of the Ushiromiya head house, allowing that clumsiness to be exposed today of all days was surely nothing less than total humiliation.`
`"Lay off, Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` Don't you think it's a little harsh to bully Shannon‐chan when she's trying her best?"`
`"I'm not bullying anyone...!"`
`"What a nice smell.`
` May I ask you the brand of this tea?"`
`"............Umm...`
`......I'm, ...I'm terribly sorry...`
` I'll find out for you later..."`
`Kyrie had tried to be nice to her, wanting to cut through the tense mood.`
`...However, instead, Shannon had shown a disgraceful display, darkening Natsuhi's face and the room's mood.`
`By this point, Eva's giggles were loud enough to be heard by everyone in the room.`
`"Whaat's thiis?`
` Shannon‐chan, don't you even know what you're pouring us?`
` Come now, you mustn't serve something so suspicious to guests.`
` We'll need a silver spoon at the very least before we can drink this."`
`".........I, ...I'm sorry......`
` I'll go get one immediately—"`
`"Shannon‐chan?`
` Do you know what silver spoons are used for?`
` Or why they have to be silver?`
` Do you know why?"`
`"...............no...`
`.........umm......"`
`Eva's eyes played over Shannon, who was setting the table, as a catty smile floated onto her face.`
`...Taken on its own, the expression on Eva's face may have been charming, in an impish sort of way.`
`However, the words being spun from her lips held within them the keenness of a razor.`
`Shannon tried with all her might to avoid Eva's gaze, which continued to focus on her.`
`Grasping that Shannon was hard‐pressed for an answer, Rosa promptly gave some timely help.`
`"They say that silver dims if it is touched by poison.`
` ...*giggle*, you've learned something, right, Shannon‐chan?"`
`The tea was being treated as undrinkable unless it could first be tested for poison.`
`In Natsuhi's eyes, this was an insult to both the tea...and herself for serving it.`
`Rudolf, laughing flippantly, patted Eva's shoulder.`
`"Haha, you don't need any silver cutlery.`
` With just one lick of your poisonous tongue, even a silver plate would go pitch black."`
`"Wahahahaha!`
` I get to hear that poison‐tongue every day, so I must be poison‐proof by now!`
` Eva, I don't mind you doing it to me, but you've gotta tone it down a smidgen for the poor souls without resistance!`
` Wahahahaha!"`
`"My, how cruel.`
` I only gave Shannon‐chan a bit of information about tea, didn't I?`
` *giggle*."`
`Everyone followed the lead set by Hideyoshi's horselaugh and smiled, though sourly.`
`There remained a single exception to this in Natsuhi, but even so, for the time being, the conversation inside the {ruby:çeviri > salon:parlor} could now be mistaken for a lively and friendly chat.`
`As Shannon finally finished setting the tea table and made to leave, Kyrie apologized to her in a low voice for not being able to help.`
`...Shannon gave a light bow and made a hasty retreat......`
`Shannon cast her eyes downwards, pushing the cart down the corridor...`
`The pitiful air around her made it obvious that she had borne the brunt of some bullying.`
`"......Don't be sad.`
` You didn't do anything wrong, Nee‐san."`
`"...............You were watching."`
`"That is my duty."`
`"........................"`
`"Madam and Eva‐sama can go to hell.`
` ......But the even worse coward is that guy."`
`Kanon glared hatefully in the opposite direction of the {ruby:çeviri > salon:parlor}.`
`The preparations for the tea had been delayed by a little bit of trouble in the kitchen.`
`That trouble had not been Shannon's fault.`
`{n}The truth is that it had been Gohda's mistake.`
`In the first place, there was no way that a showoff like Gohda would ever hand over a flamboyant job like carting the tea to the guests.`
`He had needed to make the tea all over again, which had made him late.`
`So, realizing that he wouldn't be earning any brownie points, he had pushed the task of setting the table on Shannon, who happened to be passing by.`
`......One could truthfully call it being shrewd, and one could unquestionably call it cowardice.`
`"......It's alright, Kanon‐kun, thank you.`
` ...I really don't mind..."`
`"................................."`
`Kanon's silence vividly showed that Shannon's words weren't coming from her heart.`
`"............Thank you.`
` Even if you're the only one who understands, I still feel a bit better, I think."`
`"......You bottle things up too much, Nee‐san.`
` ......You should be less hard on yourself for once."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Thanks."`
`Suddenly, they both felt someone's presence and whirled around.`
`An elderly man stood there.`
`{n}It was Genji, the head {ruby:çeviri > hizmetkar:servant}.`
`"..................What are you doing here?`
` ...Shannon, hurry back to the kitchen."`
`"Y‐yes.`
` ......If you'll excuse me......"`
`"................................."`
`Shannon humbly obeyed and promptly made to push the cart and leave.`
`However, Kanon appealed to Genji in silence, bearing something in his eyes that he could not express in words.`
`"...............What is it?`
` Did something happen...?"`
`"...Sha‐`
`......Shannon didn't do anything wrong,`
` but those—"`
`"Stop it, Kanon‐kun..."`
`"......If you'll excuse me.`
` I'll return to work immediately.`
` Kanon‐kun, you too, go back to your post.`
` ......Please."`
`"............If you say so, Nee‐san."`
`"..................`
` ...If there is nothing, then go."`
`"......Yes.`
` ......If you'll excuse me."`
`From the shadows in the hallway, an old woman wearing an apron watched over them. It was Kumasawa...`
`......How heartrending, Shannon‐san, Kanon‐san...`
`There's no reason for those two to be picked on.`
` ...But, it cannot be denied that they are disliked by Gohda‐san...`
`Before Gohda‐san was taken in by the Ushiromiya head house, I heard he worked for a fabulous hotel somewhere.`
`I do think the manner of work he learned there was quite something.`
`It's just that...Gohda‐san is the newest {ruby:çeviri > hizmetkar:servant} here.`
`...He must have a lot of pride accumulated from his previous posts.`
`Because Shannon‐san and Kanon‐kun are his seniors here at the {ruby:çeviri > malikane:mansion}, and yet are inexperienced and have gone through much less in life than he has, he picks on them at every chance he gets...`
`And also, ...although it's terrible, they are hated by Madam Natsuhi too...`
`Of course, in terms of experience, Madam has been in the family much longer.`
`However.........I must feel some sympathy for Madam as well in this case.`
`...The {ruby:çeviri > Efendi:Master} is a truly cruel person...`
`Why could he not have realized that his trifling whim would pass such an inferiority complex onto Madam...`
`......Naturally, deep inside, even Madam fully acknowledges that there's no reason to treat those two so harshly...`
`...However, the heart has reasons that reason knows not...`
`Ahh, how heartrending...`
`I cannot do anything but watch over them from the shadows......`
